# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with **HMR** (Hot Module Replacement) and some **ESLint** rules for code quality and consistency.

## Available Plugins

Currently, two official plugins are available to integrate React with Vite:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md)  
  Uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh (HMR), ensuring smooth development experience and compatibility with a wide range of features.

- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)  
  Uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) (a super-fast JavaScript/TypeScript compiler) for Fast Refresh, providing faster builds and improved performance.
